# learning-istio

## Kubernetes Cluster

Done in Azure with Terraform. See `./terraform_kubernetes_cluster`

## Istio

Mostly `bash` in `./istio`. I've provided some write-up here along with a TLDR (summary) and take-away note(s) at the end. They're all intended to be run from the `./istio` dir. 

### 00 Install Istio

You install it with this command. Istio comes with several ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù. These profiles are like ready-made values files that define the configuration for the Istio operator.  

```
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
```

You can dump that profile with this command. It‚Äôs 540 lines tho. 

```
istioctl profile dump demo 
```

The most basic component of Istio is the envoy proxy. To enable automatic sidecar injection in a namespace (automatically install envoy) you need to label it. You can also use istioctl to alter YAML files before applying them but nah. 

```
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

#### TLDR

This is made easy by the `istioctl` tool. Just run the scripts to install istio and download the sample applications locally.
- üìù Istio automatic sidecar injection is only automatic if you label your namespace

### 01 Install the bookinfo sample app

Istio comes with a *bunch* of sample apps, this one is 
[the `bookinfo` app](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/).
Bookinfo is comprised of four services, their service accounts, and their deployments. They are all contained in the first file. The second file (Gateway) deploys our first istio object, a 
[Gateway](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#gateways)
, which is analogous to an ingress controller in native kubernetes. It also deploys a 
[VirtualService](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#virtual-services)
which is like a normal kubernetes service but with more service-mesh 
[synergy](https://www.statista.com/chart/24102/share-who-hate-business-phrases/).

#### TLDR
- üìù Istio Gateway: Like a k8s ingress that also does egress. Essentially a proxy.
- üìù Istio VirtualService: Like a k8s service but with more rules. These map requests to destinations via routing rules.
